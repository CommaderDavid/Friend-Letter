<h1>Hello From Afar</h1>
<p>Dear @Model.Recipient,</p>
<p>How are you? I hope that you are having a nice weekend. I'm vacationing in @Model.Start while I learn programming!</p>
<p>@Model.Recipient, you would not believe how @Model.Complaint it is here. I should have gone to @Model.Wish instead.</p>
<p>But I like programming a lot, so I've got that going for me.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you soon. I'll bring you back a souvenir.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Travel Enthusiast @Model.Sender</p>
<h3>I got you @Model.Souvenir!</h3>
